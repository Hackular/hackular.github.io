# Hackular

Hackular is a series of modules and components for Eurorack Synth Modules.
These parts are designed to make it easier to hack on your own modular creations.

Hackular addresses some primary concerns I had when I started hacking on modular synths:

  * Reliable connection to my synth's dual rail power supply.
  * Correct pinout conventions for jacks, power supply etc.
  * Reasonable shielding on signal paths when possible.
  * Reliable breadboard wiring connections to 'physically active parts' such as:
    * Rotary Encoders
    * Sliders
    * Jacks
    * Buttons
  * Jumper cable and Patch cable management - such that they didnt interfere with each other.

# Modules and Components
All modules and components are very early in production. Use this key to get a feel for progress (from most to least complete):

| **Released** | Tested and ready to use and DIY. |
| **Prototype** | There is a working prototype. |
| **Design** | The initial design is complete. |
| **Concept** | For consideration. |

## Slice Of Bread
**Prototype**

Hacking Central.

Comes with:
  * 1 small prototyping breadboard
  * 4 x 3.5mm switched mono jacks
  * Headers for positive and negative power rails
  * Keyed Header for Doepfer style power bus.
  * Diode protection for power rails
  * Additional header for +5v rail (not necessarily supported on your bus)
  * Additional header for system Gate and CV
  * 2 x Bespoke power rail jumper cables
  * 4 x Bespoke shielded jumper cables for signal paths

## The Stack
**Concept**

Maximal breadboard density

Comes with:
  * 3 x

## Derivitive of Mutable Instuments

Much of Hackular's engineering, parts choices and base design files are lifted directly from (Mutable Instrument's)[http://mutable-instruments.net/] (open source hardware)[https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack]. I would like to thank Olivier Gillet of Mutable Instuments for inspiring me and for keeping his work open source.

This does not consitute any form of endorsement by Mutable Instruments or Olivier Gillet.
